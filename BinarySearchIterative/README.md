# Searching
Binary Searching Algorithm using Java to solution. 

Giving sorted array, find the target number.
Defind the array a
    . create valuable, and set the beginning of the index of the array.
    . create a valuable, and set it to the end of index of the array.
            To the end of the array, you need to call length on the array
Need to find the milde index of the array
    .while loop to compair beginnig and end index of the array. while(beginning <= ending)
    create a value call mild and set equal to beginning + ending of the index array and dive by 2. 
    --if stement if the mid is equal to the element we are looking for return the element.
    -- else if the milder element is smaller than the target we are looking, we going to start looking at the left side of array which are the biggest element of the array since the array is sorted.
    -- if the milder bigger than the target we are looking, we going to start looking at the right side of array which are the smartest element of the array since the array is sorted.
